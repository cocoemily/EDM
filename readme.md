# EDMpy (Alpha)
The Python version of EDM-Mobile and EDMWin.

This is an Alpha version which I am making public so that some colleagues can test the program.  For me, Alpha means there are bugs and unfinished features.  The core functionality should be there (i.e. setup the total station and save data).  However, it is strongly recommended that you use this version with caution and that you have a backup plan (e.g. EDM-Mobile or EDMWin).  What I am looking for here is feedback.  Note that I will be pushing bug and feature fixes to this site throughout the summer.  My hope is that I can reach Beta version by the end of the summer (i.e. I can find no bugs).
